# proj-AntarcticaTMA
Code and data for the analysis of Antarctic single frame trimetrogon aerial (TMA) photographs. Initial focus for this project is the Amundsen Sea Embayment, and flight lines which covered the ice shelf and lower ice stream of Pine Island Glacier in the late 1960's.

## Description of data 
The **Antarctic TMA** data are historical trimetrogon aerial photographs taken between 1946-2000. TMA photographs were taken as part of a series of U.S. based expeditions to Antarctica:
- Operation Highjump (U.S. Navy, 1946-1947)
- Operation Windmill (U.S. Navy, 1947-1948)
- Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (private, 1947–1948)
- Operation Deep Freeze I-IV (U.S. Navy, 1955–1959)
- Operation Deep Freeze 1960-present (U.S. Navy, 1960–present)

Photographs acquired before the mid-1970's are the most complete pre-satellite record of Antarctic coastline geometries and surface features which exist. From the early 1960's onwards, these data were used in the creation of USGS sketch maps and topographic reconnaisance maps of the Antarctic coastline. These photographs were 

From the USGS:
> TMA photography is a system of cameras positioned to take vertical, left oblique, and right oblique images simultaneously for use in topographic mapping. The TMA images are taken along a single flight line with the oblique cameras pointed at a depression angle of 30°. Each of the three cameras has an angular field of view of 60°, which provides a 180° horizon to horizon coverage when the images are placed side-by-side. Not all flights were equipped with oblique cameras, and equipment malfunctions limited the availability of complete sets of photography.

The film photographs were scanned to digitial images by the USGS in June 2009, and transferred to the National Archive and Records Administration (NARA) for permanent storage. The digitial image files were transferred to the Polar Geospatial Center (PGC), an NSF research center at the University of Minnesota, which hosts the data and makes them publicly accessible.
